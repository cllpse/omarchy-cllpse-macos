Everything the `omarchy-cllpse-theme` themes need that lives **outside** an
Omarchy theme folder — fonts, fontconfig, GTK settings, font hinting, Hyprland
env var + window decoration (rounding, blur), and colour configs for apps Omarchy
doesn't theme. Omarchy's design puts all of this at
machine level (it applies to every theme, reading whatever palette is active),
so it can't ship inside a theme folder.

## Use

```bash
./apply.sh     # install everything + apply the theme (keeps light if light is active)
./revert.sh    # undo everything, restoring what the machine had before
```

`revert.sh` only ever **undoes** — it never picks a font or theme for you. Omarchy
has no `font reset` / `theme reset`, so `apply.sh` records the font and theme the
machine had *before* it first ran (in `~/.local/state/cllpse-macos/`) and
`revert.sh` puts those back. Values that are already ours are refused at record
time, so re-running `apply.sh` can't turn revert into a no-op.

With nothing recorded, revert deletes the `fonts.conf` that `omarchy-font-set`
generates — `monospace` then falls back to the packaged default on its own — and
tells you the terminal configs may still name SF Mono rather than guessing a
replacement.

Both are idempotent, need **no sudo**, and are safe to re-run.

## What `apply.sh` does

| # | Action | Target |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Symlink both `omarchy-cllpse-theme/` folders as themes, and `omarchy-cllpse-switcher/` as a plugin | `~/.config/omarchy/themes/omarchy-cllpse-theme-{dark,light}`, `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/io.eject.window-switcher` |
| 2 | Install SF fonts + fontconfig drop-ins (UI font + hintnone) | `~/.local/share/fonts/SF/`, `~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d/{99-cllpse-macos-ui-font,11-cllpse-macos-hinting}.conf` |
| 3 | Monospace → SF Mono (Omarchy's own knob) | `omarchy font set` → terminal configs + `fonts.conf` |
| 4 | GTK/GNOME fonts → SF Pro / SF Mono | `gsettings org.gnome.desktop.interface` |
| 5 | Font hinting → `none` — SF faces render unhinted; grid-snapped stems read as sharp under grayscale AA (Wayland fractional scaling) | `gsettings … font-hinting 'none'` (GTK/GNOME) + fenced `freetype-load-flags = no-hinting` in `~/.config/ghostty/config` (fontconfig side is the step-2 drop-in) |
| 6 | `OMARCHY_MENU_FONT` + cursor theme + `no_warps` + keyboard layout (`hyprland.lua`), decoration/blur/opacity/animations (`looknfeel.lua`), window-switcher keybinds (`bindings.lua`), mouse tuning (`input.lua`) + `decoration` (`rounding = 14` / `rounding_power = 2.2`, `blur` on @ size 12 / passes 3 / vibrancy 0.20, `border_size = 2`, `gaps_in/out = 8/16`) + window `opacity = 1.0 0.88` + 2× animation speeds + `layer_rule` blur on the shell surfaces | fenced blocks synced into `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` and `~/.config/hypr/looknfeel.lua` |
| 7 | `bat` / `lazygit` / `fzf` colours → terminal ANSI | `~/.config/bat/config`, `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml`, fenced block in `~/.bashrc` |
| 7b | Restore saved display scaling + text size from `display.conf` (skipped if the file is absent; each empty key skipped) | `omarchy display text size`, the two scale variables in `~/.config/hypr/monitors.lua` |
| 7c | Install session environment drop-ins (Figma → native Wayland) | `~/.config/environment.d/50-cllpse-macos-figma-wayland.conf` |
| 8 | Apply the theme — refreshes whichever cllpse-macos theme is already active, else sets dark | `omarchy theme set …` |

The blur `layer_rule` only opts the shell surfaces *into* blur; the matching
translucency (`background-alpha`) is the theme's half —
`omarchy-cllpse-theme/*/shell.*.toml`. Blur shows nothing until both are in place. The rule's
namespace match also covers `omarchy-window-switcher-hud`, so the
`omarchy-cllpse-switcher/` plugin (symlinked in step 1) blurs like the menu.

Injected blocks are wrapped in `>>> cllpse-macos overrides >>>` fences (comment
leader `--` in Lua, `#` in shell — Ghostty config takes `#`); `revert.sh` deletes
exactly those. Pre-existing `~/.config/bat/config` /
`~/.config/lazygit/config.yml` are saved as `*.pre-cllpse` and restored on
revert.

**Re-running updates an existing block in place.** `sync_fenced` replaces the
fenced region and leaves everything around it alone, so edits to
`hypr/looknfeel-decoration.lua` reach an already-applied machine. (The earlier
`append_fenced` bailed whenever it saw the marker, which silently pinned a
machine to whatever version it first installed.) If the block already matches the
snippet the file is not rewritten at all.

## Display scaling + text size

```bash
./save-display.sh    # capture the machine's current values into display.conf
./apply.sh           # restore them (step 7b)
```

`display.conf` holds three keys — `text-size`, `monitor-scale`, `gdk-scale`.
Only the two **scale variables** in `~/.config/hypr/monitors.lua` are written
(`omarchy_monitor_scale` / `omarchy_gdk_scale`, both stock Omarchy variables the
`hl.monitor()` lines reference). Monitor topology — outputs, modes, positions —
is never touched, so the same `display.conf` is safe on different hardware even
though the values themselves are a preference.

`text-size` goes through `omarchy display text size`, which moves the shell's rem
root, the GTK `text-scaling-factor` and the terminal point size together.

These are **the author's values**, tuned for a 3840x1600 display, and they are
not part of the macOS look — edit `display.conf` or re-run `save-display.sh` on
your own machine. Since `apply.sh` reasserts them on every run, retuning by hand
and *not* re-saving means the next apply pulls you back; `save-display.sh` is how
you make a change stick. Scale changes land on the next Hyprland reload.

Step 8 matters more than it looks: `omarchy theme set` **copies** the theme
folder into `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/` rather than symlinking it, so
it is also what publishes a theme-folder edit — a new background, a changed
`shell.*.toml` — to the live desktop.

Hinting is `hintnone` on three fronts that don't share a knob: the fontconfig
drop-in covers Qt / Alacritty / Electron; `gsettings font-hinting` covers
GTK/GNOME; the Ghostty block covers Ghostty (Kitty hardcodes light hinting —
no override). Middle ground if it reads too soft: `hintslight` + `autohint`.

## Follow-ups `apply.sh` can't do live

- **Log out / back in** (or reboot) for `OMARCHY_MENU_FONT` — `hl.env` only applies at Hyprland start. (The `looknfeel.lua` decoration block — rounding, blur — picks up on the theme-set reload in step 8; the Omarchy shell re-reads what it mirrors on that same `omarchy theme set`, or `omarchy-restart-shell`.)
- **Open a new shell** for the `fzf` colours.
- **Restart Ghostty / Foot** windows for the new monospace font + `hintnone` (Kitty/Alacritty reload themselves).
- **Relaunch running GTK/Qt apps + the bar** to pick up `hintnone`.
- **Log out / back in** for the `environment.d` drop-ins — the systemd user session reads them at session start.
